# PasswordChecker

Can someone help me with this problem. Im asked to check if the password of a user is strong or weak. The maximum number of characters is 17. The pass word will be strong if the user entered at least 2 numbers, 2 special characters and at least 7 characters (comprimised of special character/letters)
